CYFI 330 - 700 HTC Quiz (1)
The HTC Desire mobile device’s contents have been imaged and extracted and you uploaded
it to your OneDrive. You are back at the office and ready to begin the tedious process of
recovering evidence for your extortion case. The evidence file is the same as the HTC pre-quiz
you started last week. Please give me a written response, screenshot(s) and path(s) for every
question. Don’t even think about asking me for extension or turning this in late.
1. Show the email account and telephone number and profile pic for user account1
2. What is the ICCID number of this device?
3. You indicated the telephone number of this device in the pre-quiz. What geographic
area is the area code registered?
4. Show images of any three persons (do NOT use Jimi Hendrix or Steven Ray Vaugh)
5. There is a long memo in the evidence. Please show an excerpt of this memo
6. There are some active images. Show two of these. Hint: one jpg and one gif
7. There is a deleted audio file. Show what type of file this is
8. There is a deleted image file in an ‘old school’ format i.e NOT jpg format. Show this
image and name the format.
9. A social media account belonging to John Doe is located in the evidence. Show the
profile pic.
10. Your HTC evidence and all Android devices have two primary types of memory: 1.
Volatile (RAM), 2. Non-Volatile (NAND flash) memory. From which of these two types of
memory can I find things like passwords, encryption keys, usernames, or App data. Can
you show an example of this in an exhibit? You must answer the question but if you
can’t show me an example you will still get full credit. If you show me an example, then I
may give extra credit.
