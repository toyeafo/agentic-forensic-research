Objective: Extract all emails from the forensic disk image provided.

   * Image File Path: [Path to your disk image file, e.g., HTC_Desire_S.img]
   * Analysis Strategy:
       * Use fdisk -l to identify partition offsets.
       * Directly analyze the partitions using the sleuthkit (fls, icat). Do not attempt to mount the image.
       * Focus on partitions with [filesystem type, e.g., ext4] filesystems, which likely contain user data.
   * Target Application Data:
       * Search for application data directories belonging to [List of email clients, e.g., "Gmail", "HTC
         Mail", "Outlook"].
       * Locate and extract the underlying database files (typically .db files).
   * Data Extraction:
       * Use sqlite3 to query the extracted database files.
       * Extract the following fields: [List of desired fields, e.g., sender, recipients, subject, body,
         date].
   * Output:
       * Consolidate all found emails into a single CSV file named [Desired output file name, e.g.,
         extracted_emails.csv].
